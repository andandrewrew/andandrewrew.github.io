<a href="http://kuenstlerhaus.de/">Kunstlerhaus Stuttgart</a></h1>
<p dir="ltr">The second manifestation of <em>This Light</em> takes place within the exhibition <a href="http://techne-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://techne-stuttgart.de/en/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1510000653222000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHlHiz-rKGFJx5P2ZRw8LKnE4yUzw">Techne and the Decency of Means</a> at the Kunstlerhaus Stuttgart. A full scale model of the cinema that will eventually be constructed in a backyard in Los Angeles is installed at the Kunstlerhaus, and it will screen hundreds of moving image works over the course of the exhibition. Because the Kunstlerhaus has a residency program, the building is zoned as mixed-use and the cinema within is able to be defined as a private residence. Therefore, the  free screenings  of commercial media fall under the non-commercial, home use only clause of German copyright law.</p>

<p>This event is an attempt to describe a free cinema that emerges out of a desire to make private viewing habits public. The cinema goes by the name This Light. At a time when public space is rapidly dissolving into private property and attention is dissolving into the monetized distraction of streaming content in solitude, the cinema activates the possibilities offered through networked technology and opens the domestic up to what could be called anybody. </p>
<p>To some extent, This Light is a reaction to the lack of a screening venue (or even a regular screening series) in Los Angeles committed to expanding the definition of moving images as an art form. With no particular allegiances to anything, This Light seeks to dissolve boundaries between different audiences through uncommon arrangements.<br />
  <br />
The architecture of the first cinema will be an informal, parasitic structure that exploits the environmental potentials of a private back yard in Southern California. By day it will be a functional camera obscura (closed roof) or breathable patio sunshade (open roof), by night a soundproofed cinema with an HD projector, hifi soundsystem, and comfortable seating. It will be lightweight and portable enough to be moved to a new site if need be, drawing on the history of nomadic units as an emancipatory project.</p>
<p>The works included in the announcement describe forms that do not yet exist, and enact a gradual illumination of the cinema. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="http://techne-stuttgart.de/this-light-phase-iv-by-saul-bass/"><em>Phase IV</em></a><br />
  November 16 2017 at 7 pm</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><img src="EventImages/PhaseIV.png" width="900" height="492" /></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Phase IV</em> by Saul Bass<br />
1h 24min ● 35mm ● Colour ● Sound ● 1974</p>
<p dir="ltr">Free microwave popcorn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Intro:</p>
<p dir="ltr">In September 2016 I published a tweet that read:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>been around the globe lately and if theres one universal truth ive found its that when u sit on the ground ants r gonna get up in yr shit</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In that month I had been to Korea, Germany, Chicago, Texas, and Los Angeles, and in each setting had enjoyed the summer weather sitting by the shore of a body of water, albeit with ants crawling up my legs and into my shorts. Like when Sheryl Crow sings &ldquo;Put on a poncho, and played for mosquitoes&rdquo; about playing an outdoor music festival in the rain in her song If It Makes You Happy, I accept the inevitability of both an audience of insects and climate conditions as factors in the process of running a backyard cinema. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Without spoiling Phase IV, one of the things that draws me to the film is the &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t beat them, join them&rdquo; moral of the story. Not only is a significant portion of the movie&rsquo;s energies invested in establishing the ants themselves as protagonists, the privilege that humanity typically assumes over other lifeforms in the environment at large here leads to negative consequences. Meanwhile, the characters that fare best are the ones that understand the limitations of their own perspective. As you&rsquo;ll see, an openness to other forms of complex intelligence and its expressions - such as the mathematically based geometrical forms that the ants construct as a form of communication - presents humans with a fuller range of what thinking can be.  </p>
<p>You may know, or have at least seen, the work of Saul Bass through his corporate logos for Continental Airlines and AT&amp;T, or his film poster and motion-picture title sequences for Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s North by Northwest, Vertigo, and Psycho. Less celebrated, especially at the outset due to poor marketing, is Phase IV - his sole feature length effort from 1974. And so I thank you for coming out tonight to celebrate it.</p>

<p>&quot;I had become so quiet and so small in the grass by the pond that I was barely noticeable, hardly there. I think they had forgotten all about me. I sat there watching their living room shine out of the dark beside the pond. It looked like a fairy tale functioning happily in the post-World War II gothic of America before television crippled the imagination of America and turned people indoors and away from living out their own fantasies with dignity.&quot;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Valley of the Dolls: On Processing Tragedy</em> is a series of films and videos centered around the question: When confronted w a spectacularized image of tragedy, how can a public react? Beginning with the recent film, <em>Casting JonBenet</em>, which highlights the lasting impact of the JonBenet Ramsey case on the psyche of the American public, this series moves out of the formal realm of documentary into that of the “fan”-made tribute video. Photos of JonBenet put together in iMovie or the PC equivalent are accompanied by songs too mature for a six-year- old, but just right for the older YouTubers trying to make sense of her death even twenty years later. There’s a strange affinity between these and the melodrama of the American Girl Stop Motion videos, made painstakingly over months of continuous work, as well as the young and old learning forgiveness from the body of Maria Goretti, our youngest saint, patron saint of chastity and of rape victims, martyred in 1902 and canonized in 1950 in front of the largest crowd the Vatican had ever seen. We generally have an inability to accept the deaths of those gone too soon, but we are completely unable to let go of those that are bastions of purity, promises of a better us. The sweet, the doll-like. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Though older at the time of her death than JonBenet and Maria, Karen Carpenter—the sweet girl from Downey—holds a similar place in our cultural memory. When Todd Haynes reenacted her life with a Barbie doll, while evoking important connections between this young face of a new Conservative youth and the 1950s ideal woman realized in 1:6 scale, he also recalled and prefigured the wax saintly relic of young Maria Goretti and the YouTube videos of those with no better way to memorialize lost youth. </p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a rumor, from a JonBenet community forum, that believes her American Girl dolls may be the key to exposing her family as her murderers. Jahazafat, a former worker at a call center that filled orders for American Girl dolls, writes that in her training as a customer service rep, she was taught to tell customers who complained of their American Girl heads coming loose to fix them with duct tape. The duct tape found at the Ramseys’ house, which had mysterious fibers, was believed by investigators to have come from outside the house due to no roll of duct tape being found there. Jahazafat, however, says that tan fibers on the tape match the tan cloth body of American Girl dolls, and the mysterious blue fibers found near the scene match the skirt of the Molly doll. The Ramsey family had been allowed to remove JonBenet’s American Girls from the house, due to our national understanding of the sentimentality of these dolls, but Jahazafat believes it is because the dolls would show gummy marks where the duct tape was removed from their necks and planted at the scene of the crime. Her smoking gun is a purchase record she found showing that in 1997, after JonBenet’s death, a new doll was sent to JonBenet—in name—herself, most likely to replace the dolls disposed of in the aftermath of the crime’s cover-up. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Because why would a dead girl receive a doll?</p>

<p>In the latter half of 2017, the thinkpiece economy lobbed a dose of interest to the eery, uncanny world of YouTube content for children. The most viral article, James Bridle&rsquo;s Medium post &ldquo;<a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1512763403588000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlSh-WsrEDUox4AlVeBwogtth1xQ">Something is wrong with the internet</a>&rdquo; surveys, in rather sensational terms, how YouTube&rsquo;s algorithms, clickbait culture, and user-end profit incentives have led to algorithmically generated content designed to maximize and exploit those systems, in increasingly surreal and horrific combinations. There are several recognizable motifs, the most popular of which include &ldquo;Yes Papa,&rdquo; a nursery rhyme about deceiving your parents, the &ldquo;Finger Family Song&rdquo; nursery rhyme game, which is about assigning nuclear family roles to fingers on a hand, and &ldquo;Wrong Heads,&rdquo; which is a kind of peek-a-boo of dismemberment. Typically, these games are played out by characters from recent popular children&rsquo;s media. There are also TV episode-length &ldquo;cartoons&rdquo; with action so meandering that they can only be created by loose, lazy artificial intelligence: usually rendered with a Grand Theft Auto CGI engine, Spiderman, Elsa, the Joker, and various superheroes stock animals meander through several vague actions and scenarios (swimming, racing, fighting), somehow filling time. There are countless YouTube channels recompiling these simple games in thinly veiled permutations: dozens of versions of &ldquo;Wrong Head&rdquo; with different combinations of characters, the same &ldquo;Yes Papa&rdquo; sequence re-skinned with different characters, half-hour cartoons repeating the same sequence, starring a Purple Elsa in one and a Red Elsa with Joker Makeup in the next. Here we find the mechanistic libidinal economy of Marquis de Sade&rsquo;s fiction in digital technicolor: every character is exhaustively subjected to every act of transmission, transformation, and conflict. </p>
<p>Bridle writes: &ldquo;I can understand how [these videos] might provide some of the rhythm or cadence or relation to their own experience that actual babies are attracted to in this content, [which] has been warped and stretched through algorithmic repetition and recombination in ways that I don&rsquo;t think anyone actually wants to happen.&rdquo; Yet beyond the uncanny valley effects of this zombie content, he also identifies a sinister, human-led motifs which have poisoned the stream of autoplay: the Joker drugging and abducting Elsa; Elsa getting spinal surgery; &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; videos which seem designed to traumatize, such as Peppa Pig getting a taste of bacon and cannibalizing her family, and eventually herself; and most predominantly, syringe injection, which serves as a general symbolic vehicle for transformation, but also punishment (&ldquo;Crying Babies! Accident! Bad baby Playing Doctor &amp; Learn Colors With Injections! Finger Family Song&rdquo;). While it began in animation, these genres have crossed over to live-action content, with real actors, sometimes children, being subject to the same sadism of algorithmic payoff, to the tune of millions of views (though it&rsquo;s likely that many of these views are themselves automated, too). </p>
<p>In the wake of Bridle&rsquo;s exposé, the Reddit community has dubbed this phenomenon &ldquo;ElsaGate.&rdquo; Awareness swelled to the point that major advertisers such as Adidas pulled funding from YouTube, finally forcing the company to address its long-standing failures of content moderation. In late November, YouTube purged much of this content, including entire channels, deleting literally billions of views, and some of their most popular, verified accounts. And rightly so.</p>
<p> While it remains to be seen how far YouTube will take their newfound moderation, what remains in December are the less flagrantly horrific algorithmic videos, examples of which are compiled on this playlist. Although they lack the shock of Mickey Mouse getting his ear scissored off, or of Spiderman receiving punitive ass injections from Goku, or of a real-life child being forced to pretend to pee themselves while adults in costumes laugh at them, I think that they retain the gut horror of this content, which is that they embrace the cold antihumanism of clickbait culture as it pivots to video. The most vocal ElsaGate detractors stage this as a problem of saving the children, to the point that they&rsquo;re elaborating conspiracy theories not dissimilar to PizzaGate – but I think what&rsquo;s truly scary is that these videos travel in the same patterns as pornography, or Facebook viral videos, or Instagram memes, strategically gaming commercialized media platforms which are themselves designed for maximum libidinal payoff. Their concern for pre-literate babies is a displacement of the fact that we&rsquo;re all post-literate ones. Won&rsquo;t somebody think for the children?</p>
